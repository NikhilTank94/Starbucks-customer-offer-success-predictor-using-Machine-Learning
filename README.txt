# Starbucks-customer-offer-success-predictor 

For predicting the influence of rewards and offer on customers, built a machine learning model that determines which demographic groups will respond best to which offer type and duration; resulting in better marketing strategies and improving customer reach and satisfaction. 

Tools used: Amazon SageMaker, XGBoost, PyTorch, Python. 

1. The main code is in Starbucks_Capstone_notebook.ipynb this has to be run for both benchmark and main model. 
2. Scripts has a .py file which is used to preprocess the transcript.json file.
3. The pytorch require 3 .py code which are in pytorch. These don't need to be run, as they run from main code.
